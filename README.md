This project introduces a temperature-based automatic fan speed controller that adjusts the speed of an electric fan according to the ambient temperature. Leveraging embedded technology, this closed-loop feedback control system ensures high efficiency and reliability. Project is highly relevant for several reasons. Firstly, it promotes energy efficiency by optimizing power usage. The system adjusts the fan speed according to the ambient temperature, ensuring that the fan operates at higher speeds only when necessary. This not only conserves energy but also results in significant cost savings, making it an economically viable solution for both industrial and domestic applications. Secondly, the project enhances comfort and convenience with its user-friendly interface.
The reviewed papers collectively illustrate the advancements in temperature-based automatic fan speed control systems using microcontroller and IoT technologies. These systems effectively optimize energy consumption and enhance user comfort through real-time temperature adjustments, offering reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for various applications. The successful implementations demonstrate the potential for further innovations in automated environmental control systems, showcasing their adaptability and efficiency.
This project aims to create an efficient and cost-effective system for regulating fan speed based on temperature readings. It works based on threshold value. First, we initialise all the things then read the temperature this base we take the decision.
The project utilizes a variety of essential components to achieve temperature-based automatic fan speed control. Central to the system is the NodeMcu 8266 microcontroller, which orchestrates all functions. Temperature and humidity readings are provided by the DHT11 sensor, while real-time data is displayed on a phone screen. The motor driver acts as a switch to control the 12-volt DC fan, moderated by a 1KÎ© resistor to ensure appropriate current flow.
